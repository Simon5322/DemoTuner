1) Parameter: work_mem
   Recommended Value: increase
   Circumstances: 
   - When performing complex queries with multiple sort or hash operations running in parallel.
   - When dealing with a read-heavy workload that involves ORDER BY, DISTINCT, and merge joins.
   - When working with hash-based operations (e.g., hash joins, hash-based aggregation, memoize nodes, and hash-based processing of IN subqueries).
   - When there is a need to allocate more memory for hash tables, which are more sensitive to memory availability than sort-based operations.
   
2) Parameter: work_mem
   Recommended Value: relative to other parameters or specific metric
   Circumstances: 
   - When determining the amount of memory available for hash tables.
   - Multiply the base work_mem value by hash_mem_multiplier to compute the memory available for hash tables.
   - Adjust the work_mem value accordingly to allow hash-based operations to use a larger amount of memory than the usual work_mem base amount.
   
3) Parameter: work_mem
   Recommended Value: depends on the specific workload and requirements
   Circumstances: 
   - When choosing the initial value for work_mem parameter.
   - The default value is 4MB, but it may need to be adjusted based on the complexity of the queries and the expected amount of memory usage.
   - Consider the possibility of multiple parallel sessions performing sort or hash operations concurrently, which could result in a higher total memory usage than the value of work_mem.
   - It is necessary to evaluate the workload characteristics, SQL operations, hardware specifications, and other factors to determine the appropriate value for work_mem.

- Recommended Value: increase
- Circumstances: 
  - When the server experiences a large number of concurrent parallel queries.
  - When there is a frequent exhaustion of the allocated shared memory by parallel queries.
  - When there are performance issues related to memory management overheads.
  - When the operating system supports and manages larger pages automatically.

2. temp_file_limit:
- Recommended Value: increase or decrease
- Circumstances: 
  - Increase:
    - When there is a need for executing queries that require a significant amount of temporary disk space.
    - When sort and hash operations frequently utilize temporary files, and the current limit is leading to transaction cancellations.
  - Decrease:
    - When there is a concern about excessive disk space usage by temporary files.
    - When the current limit is unnecessarily high and imposes potential risks of excessive disk space consumption.

]Trios of tuning recommendations:

1. Trio 1:
   - Configuration parameter: effective_io_concurrency
   - Recommended value: increase
   - Circumstances: For magnetic drives, a good starting point for this setting is the number of separate drives comprising a RAID 0 stripe or RAID 1 mirror being used for the database. However, if the database is often busy with multiple queries issued in concurrent sessions, lower values may be sufficient to keep the disk array busy. A value higher than needed to keep the disks busy will only result in extra CPU overhead.

2. Trio 2:
   - Configuration parameter: effective_io_concurrency
   - Recommended value: increase
   - Circumstances: SSDs and other memory-based storage can often process many concurrent requests, so the best value might be in the hundreds.

3. Trio 3:
   - Configuration parameter: effective_io_concurrency
   - Recommended value: [1, 1000] or 0
   - Circumstances: This setting only affects bitmap heap scans. The allowed range is 1 to 1000, or zero to disable issuance of asynchronous I/O requests.

4. Trio 4:
   - Configuration parameter: maintenance_io_concurrency
   - Recommended value: increase
   - Circumstances: Similar to effective_io_concurrency, but used for maintenance work that is done on behalf of many client sessions.

5. Trio 5:
   - Configuration parameter: maintenance_io_concurrency
   - Recommended value: [1, 1000] or 0
   - Circumstances: This value can be overridden for tables in a particular tablespace by setting the tablespace parameter of the same name. The default is 10 on supported systems, otherwise 0.
